CityFireflies started as a project during the 48 hours game-coding event, Global Gamejam 2011 in Madrid. 

The game was made in such a way that it takes almost no time to start playing since the only instruction given is to turn on the phone screen. Rapidly the player can enjoy the game in a 15x10 meters Media Facade located in the Media Lab Prado, Madrid. 

Details later, here a video of how the game looks like :)
