<p>CityFireflies started as a project during the 48 hours game-coding event, Global Gamejam 2011 in Madrid.</p>
<p>The game was made in such a way that it takes almost no time to start playing since the only instruction given is to turn on the phone screen. Rapidly the player can enjoy the game in a 15&#215;10 meters Media Facade located in the Media Lab Prado, Madrid.</p>
<p>Details later, here a video of how the game looks like :)</p>
